# witness_monitor_tutorial

please see the steemit profile of @markangeltrueman for details on what all of this does. You will basically need to set up a discord bot and then change the following properties in the code

```
const accountname = 'markangeltrueman' 
let discorduser = '123234234123123234';
let token = 'your discord token here'
```

and then run the monitor using `node index.js`
